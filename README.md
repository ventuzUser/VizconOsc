# Vizcon.OSC 🎶

### About This Fork 🚀

This project is a **modernized fork of SharpOSC** by **Valdemar Örn Erlingsson**. I didn't reinvent the wheel—I just gave it a fresh coat of .NET 8 paint, sprinkled in some newer language features, and made sure it's ready for the future.

### **Original Work & Credits** 🎩

All the heavy lifting was done by Valdemar back in 2012, and this project proudly carries his work forward. It remains **free and open** under the original MIT License, so everyone can continue using, modifying, and sharing it however they see fit.

### **What’s New?** ✨

- Upgraded to **.NET 8** for modern compatibility
- Improved performance & language features
- Bug fixes and refinements

### **Installation** 📦

(If you plan to publish on NuGet, you can add installation steps here)

```sh
# Coming soon on NuGet
```

### **Usage** 📖

(Provide a short usage example if needed)

```csharp
// Example of using Vizcon.OSC
var oscSender = new OscSender("127.0.0.1", 9000);
oscSender.Send(new OscMessage("/example", 42));
```

### **Disclaimer** ⚠️

I claim no ownership over the original work—this is just an evolution. If you like it, great! If something breaks, well... you know the drill. 🔧

### **License** 📝
